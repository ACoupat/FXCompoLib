# FXCompoLib
Library containing graphical components for JavaFX

This is a personal project consisting in a library that groups all the custom JavaFX componenets that I need in my other projects.

For now it contains the following components :

- Components based on the principle of a Label that turns into an other component after double click to change the value that it holds :
  
    - EditableLabel : When you double click on the label it turns to a TextField. It is useful to manage String values
    
    - EditableDatePicker : When you double click on the label it turns to a DatePicker. It is useful to manage Dates.
    
    - EditableSpinner : When you double click on the label it turns to a spinner that can handle either integers or doubles. 
      Unsurprisingly it is useful to manage numbers.
      
  These components can be used in SceneBuilder.
  
- ImageGallery : This component allows to manage a list of images (addition, removal) and provides a view to visualize them with a greater size.
